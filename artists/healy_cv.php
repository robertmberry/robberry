<td width="900" align="center"><br /><p class="paragraph">Since 1967, Eugene Healy has pursued abstraction with collage visualized as shorescapes. He has effectively materialized his feelings about living near the water, being places that have evoked in him particular moods.  He obsessively makes many changes in his collages, utilizing a great variety of mediums until he is certain his expressions sing to the tune of Clive Bell’s concept of “significant form.” Healy has also served as a curator and exhibition designer. Jack Welch, the legendary former CEO of General Electric, is among the most enthusiastic collectors of his collages.</p></td>
